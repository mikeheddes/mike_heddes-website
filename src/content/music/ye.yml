  "Kanye doesn't shy away from darkness or drama on his 
  eighth solo album, written and recorded while holed up with
  an extended circle of friends and collaborators amid the 
  snowcapped mountains encircling Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 
  As expected, he mentions recent controversies—including 
  that notorious \"slavery was a choice\" comment—and possibly 
  sparks some new ones, name-dropping the \#MeToo movement 
  and Stormy Daniels. Even those headline-grabbing asides, 
  however, don't overshadow what are arguably the most candid 
  lyrics of Kanye's career. His mental health is a constant theme: 
  Kanye confesses to suicidal and homicidal thoughts within the
  album's opening minute, then admits he’s bipolar on 
  \"Yikes\"—but proclaims the condition is \"my super-power … 
  ain't no disability.\" He praises wife Kim Kardashian for 
  standing by him through \"the worst times\" (\"Wouldn’t Leave\") 
  and reveals how his daughters have changed his views 
  about women (\"Violent Crimes\"). Like G.O.O.D. Music 
  president Pusha-T's DAYTONA, released a week prior and 
  produced by Kanye in Wyoming, the album has just seven songs, 
  most under four minutes—his most focused and concise project yet, 
  even with yet another impressive, sprawling guest list 
  (Kid Cudi, Ty Dolla $ign, Nicki Minaj, Charlie Wilson). 
  And the production, as always, is often remarkable: 
  Kanye’s political beliefs may have changed, but his ear 
  for skillfully chopped-up samples and uplifting, 
  gospel-informed vocal arrangements hasn't."
