**For as long as gift-giving has been a tradition, thereâ€™s also been the inability to come up with good gift ideas.** Whether itâ€™s for your mom, dad, sister, brother, partner, friend, colleague, they, them, him, her, cat, dog, secret Santa, or for a White Elephant party, it can often be tricky to select the perfect present for your recipient. Price can also be a `huge factor` in holiday shopping â€” whether you have a tight budget and / or a long list of friends and family members to buy gifts for. This season can make things pretty rough on your wallet.

So as the 2017 holidays approach, The Verge put together our annual gift guide of the many wonderful things that would make great presents for all ages, sizes, genders, and budgets. At the very least, we hope these recommendations spark an idea for what you might gift your loved ones.

```js
var foo = function(bar) {
  return bar++
}

const ceder = true;
const regex = /someRegEx/;
let setUp = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';

console.log(foo(5))

```


```python
# Some Comment
import numpy as np

grade_with_weight = [
    # year 1
    (8, 5), (6, 10),  # term 1

print("GPA: ", np.average(grades, weights=weights))

s = "Python syntax highlighting"

> Mike Heddes

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4) You can use sequential numbers...
5) ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Images

Default width and extra hight:

## Code

    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"
